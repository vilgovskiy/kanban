# KanBan board

This is an example KanBan board application that consists of 3 components:  
* Backend database - PostgreSQL database that stores Users/Boards/Tasks/Relations
* Backend server - Node.js application that uses Express for routing and middleware
* Frontend web app - React web app that uses context for storing application state and makes API calls to the backend via Axios
